# Solving_Rush_Hr_Project
an A* algorithm that can solve any rush-hour board

-The program will ask for a board to solve (a sample board "board1.board" is included in the files) and a text file to write the solution to, if this file doesn't exist, it will be created.

-The solution visualizer was provided to me by the Professor who gave me this assignment. to visualize a solution

-Future plans-

-I plan to improve the efficiency of this algorithm by swapping out a few lists for sets.

-allow for relative file path input
